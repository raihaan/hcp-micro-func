this folder contains data and script for analysis of microstructural-functional coupling


All python scripts require microfunc environement (microfunc_spec.txt)
Any wb_command or wb_view requires HCP workbench (module load HCP_ConnectomeWorkbench/1.3.2 on CIC, module load cobralab/2019b on Niagara)

Dataset: HCP Young Adult
Data Types: Structural (T1w/T2w) and resting state functional

General process:
1. Identify subsets of unrelated subjects, select a set of unrealted subjects to analyze
2. Compute rsfc matrix for each individual
3. Compute microstrucutral profile similariy (MPC) for each subject
	** for this step I used previously computed collaborator data
	** output (mpc matrices) are in preprocessed/
4. Build NMF input matrix
5. Run NMF stability
6. Run final NMF based on stability
7. Run PLS



raw_data/
	contains relevant functional, structural raw data
	contains demographic spreadsheets and info on subjects analyzed
	contains precomputed atlas parcellation files downloaded

preprocessed/
	contains MPC and RSFC matrices for each subject
	contains regional coupling coefficient arrays for each subject
	contains scripts to compute these data as well

derivatives/
	contains concatenated coupling coefficients
	each subjects coupling measurements are stacked to form a region x subjects matrix for nmf analysis

analysis/
	contains scripts and outputs for pls and nmf analysis
	contains figure making scripts/files
analysis/paper
	contains scripts for making each of the 5 results figures. if you are looking for just the reproduction of figures, go here

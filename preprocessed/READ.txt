This folder computes RSFC, MPC matrices for each subject
computes coupling coefficients for each subject
coupling coefficient is the main data  to analyze in this project. It is a numregionsx1 vector (numregions=400) for each subject,
represents the node level correlation between MPC and RSFC for each subject

*MPC data is precomputed by collaborator, see mpc/ folder for more

get_mpc_data.py - writes out .txt file for each subject with name ${subjectid}_mpc.txt that is 400x400 matrix of subjects MPC data

Commands run (on Niagara):
module load cobralab/2019b

for file in ??????/*joblist; do echo bash $file; done > rsfcpreproc_joblist

This folder contains the 'main run' of NMF on the full dataset and also the stability runs in the stability/ folder

In this folder:
joblist_nmfs - a few nmfs run on varying granularities
nmf.py - wrapper script for running nmf with sklearn. takes in .mat file (input matrix must have key 'X'), shifts to get non negativity, runs nmf

To run:
module load cobralab/2019b
qbatch -c 1 -w 1:00:00 joblist_nmfs
#outputs are stored in output/

	folder containing output of nmf runs
	also includes postprocessing scripts/steps to convert nmf results to files for visualization/further analysis

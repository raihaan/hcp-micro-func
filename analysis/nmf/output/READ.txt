This folder contains nmf outputs and does some postprocessing of nmf outputs

convert.py - takes in .mat nmf results and writes out 1 .txt file for each component (ie column of W)
postproc_nmf.sh - wrapper script which runs convert.py and then converts .txt files to pscalar.nii files for visulizing in wb_view
plot_Hweights.py - script for plotting H weight matrix and related figs

To run:
./postproc_nmf.sh k4/k4.mat
python plot_Hweights.py --nmf_weights k4/k4.mat --out_dir k4/
